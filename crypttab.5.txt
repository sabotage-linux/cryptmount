crypttab(5)
=============

Name
----
crypttab - static information about dm-crypt filesystems

Synopsis
--------
/etc/crypttab

Description
-----------
The file *crypttab* contains information about encrypted volumes.
*crypttab* is intended to be read by *cryptmount*, and only written to
by human administrators. Each 'volume' is described on a separate line
by four fields. Fields are separated by whitespace. Empty lines and
lines beginning with a *#* are ignored.

The fields are
'name' 'device' ['key' ['options']]

'name'::

The name of the 'volume' which will appear at
*/dev/mapper/*'name'. This must be a plain filename without any
directory components.

'device'::

An absolute path, UUID, PARTUUID, or LABEL to a device or file which
will be mapped to */dev/mapper/*'name'.

'key' := *-* | 'keydevice'[\[*:*'fstype'] *:*'keyfile']::

This field may be blank or a *-* for interactive passwords. 'keydevice'
may be an absolute path, UUID, PARTUUID, or LABEL to a device or file
which contains the passphrase. If 'keyfile' (and 'fstype') are given,
'keydevice' will be mounted if it isn't already. 'keyfile' is an
absolute path relative to the root of the file system on 'keydevice'.
+
For compatibility with other formats, *ASK* and *none* may be used in
place of *-* and *SWAP* is an idiom for */dev/urandom* and the *swap*
option. See *OPTIONS*.
+
*Note:* A literal password in this field is *not* supported.

'options' := 'key'[*=*'value'] | *%*'tag' | 'options'*,*'options'::

The 'options' field is a comma separated list. It is described in detail
below.
+
For compatibility with other formats, if the first character is *-* then
the entire field is interpretted as a literal command line for
*cryptsetup*.

Options
-------

Most options have a one-to-one correspondence to *cryptsetup* command
line options and are simply reformatted. For example to use *cryptsetup
--cipher/-c* 'cipher' the options *cipher*='cipher' or *c*='cipher' may
be used. Other options which are used by *cryptmount* are:

*swap*::

Run *mkswap*(8) on */dev/mapper/*'name'.

*tmp*[='fs']::

Run *mkfs*(8) with the file system type of 'fs' on */dev/mapper/*'name'.
The default 'fs' is *ext4*.

*noauto*::

Do not automatically map this 'volume'.

*size*='size'::

See *cryptsetup(8) --key-size*. Other formats for *crypttab* use *size*
for the amount of bytes to read from *key*.

*device-size*='size'::

See *cryptsetup(8) --size*. This accounts for the quirk with *size*.

*%*'tag'::

Tags can be used to include or exclude a group of volumes when running
*cryptmount(8)*. Additionally, *cryptmount* automatically adds to
'volumes', with a key of */dev/urandom*, a *%random* tag. This tag is used
by the Arch Linux initscripts to delay the mapping of these volumes
until after the random seed has been restored during boot.
